# Land_record_on_blockchain
INTRODUCTION-
Land ownership system is grappling under fraudsters and people often fear being duped with fake land certificates. Land records in most states date back to the colonial era. The disputes over titles often end up in courts. In fact, over 66 percent of civil cases in India are property-related disputes.
According to McKinsey Global Institute, distortion to India’s land markets is a barrier to faster growth. For many Indians, their private residences are also their largest asset. The majority of the debt held by individuals is also linked to private residences. .
Throughout history new technology has been implemented to secure real estate ownership and transactions, and the properties associated with a particular real estate. In the beginning there was not even paper, thus putting the land registry on paper was a way to secure records of ownership.And next to increase the security,privacy and efficacy of this system the process needs to be digitize.
Despite the importance of real estate for both society and individuals,there are many loopholes in the current system.
PROBLEM-
1)Majority of the steps and processes in the land registry and transferring is not transparent or in other-words visible to public.
2)The system is slow at registering real estate transactions. The time between the signing a legally binding purchasing contract and approval of the title is often three to six months.
3)The issues above have resulted in sellers, buyers, banks and real estate agents being forced to create their own complex processes for agreements, since they have to make sure that things can’t go wrong, and because the value of the transactions is large. This creates inefficiency.
4)This leads to ineffective management of  Land, Encroachment and enforcement of town planning regulations in urban areas.
SOLUTION-
1) Increased resilience and redundancy of the transactional data in the land registry and the mortgage deed registry.
2) Greater security for users of the system, in part because validation of the purchasing contracts and ownership can be done independently via our platform. 
3) Faster and more transparent transactions.  
4) Official registration and confirmation of pending ownership around much quicker four than in the current process, which allows more information and data of transactions to be available, increase liquidity of real estate since it can      be sold by the soon to be owner, and more. 
5) Making it possible to receive automatic confirmation of final land title at the date of transaction.
6) Elimination of the possibility of selling a property more than once. 
7) Making it more difficult to steal a property.
OUR PLATFORMS WORKING ON THE SOLUTION-
1)Building a ledger system tracking digital information that will allow people to register the property bought.
2)Platform to digitally sell property. 
3)We will authenticate the credentials of users, allow them to access the records and give them a certificate. No one can tamper with the database. The buyers, too, can access relevant information on registering with their credentials
4)Building api’s to get the data and then analyzing it for activities like city palning and measures to be taken.-Later, it will let developers create a range of apps based on the available information. 
5) The technology will enable paperless governance with permissions, licences, services and transactions being managed digitally.
The blockchain is the only solution why?
1)Digital units impossible to copy
2) Digital files that can’t be manipulated-so the registered land can not be hacked and changing of owners name or making of fake document not possible.
3)Digital processes that can’t be manipulated -NO chance of double-spending problem(mistake in land transfering and registeration in the transition period of the transaction)
What are the costs and obstacles?
1)Privacy- Regulation of and securing personal data is a problem for any technology. One main difference with the blockchain is that it is very difficult to delete information. There may be conflicts between public registries and deleting personal information, but the conflict is then primarily with the digital files in general and not with the blockchain technology. If personal data is going to be deleted the person behind a public key stored in a contract in the blockchain has to be unknown to outsiders. Since real estate ownership is public in INDIA this information should however be public according to INDIAN law.
2)Digital signatures- The main concern so far is legal uncertainty about when digital signatures on a real estate contract become valid. Indian
law in this area is becoming more oriented towards electronic identification with eIDAS being one example. In India the government already receive most of the contracts for real estate transactions in digital formats from banks and agents. In 2017 this will be made possible for all citizens. As these examples show there is increasing legal acceptance of digital contracts and signatures.
Physical signatures can still be a part of the process, for example by making digital copies of paper based contracts, but for the system to function properly digital signatures must be legally unambiguous.
3)Psychology- peoples psychology to change from using paper related documents and going through the present process of digitally approved and signed document and processing. 
FUTURE-
1.All involved actors will have a digital file representing the agreement of ownership of the real estate, mortgage deeds and the transaction process. These files can be stored in the cloud, locally, or some other method of the actor’s choosing.
2.The authenticity of the process, the signatures, the file confirming ownership, mortgage deeds etc. will be secured with a blockchain. The Government will store the blockchain with the proofs, but the blockchain will also be stored and validated by other actors. It will therefore be easy for authorized third parties to verify information. These third parties would usually be actors who are part of the process: banks, buyers, sellers, real estate agents etc.
3.The records and files that should be public according to Indian law will be public and those which should be confidential will stay confidential. 
4.There will be no bearer instrument stored on the blockchain in the current implementation. This precludes the risk of such authoritative documents being lost, stolen, or tampered with. Bearer instruments could be implemented in the future, but it should be noted that doing so entails risks and legislative uncertainties that require further investigation. 5. The only way to steal a property is through entering a new real estate transaction process with stolen or forged identification. The security of the ID-solution can be improved according to the requirements of the system in question. More stringent identification procedures (photos of physical ID-cards, biometric identification, multi signatures, etc.)
